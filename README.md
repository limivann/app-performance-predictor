## Marking Rubrics

1. 10% for coming up with your own problem definition based on a dataset

2. 10% for data preparation and cleaning to suit the problem of your choice

3. 20% for exploratory data analysis/visualization to gather relevant insights

4. 20% for the use of machine learning techniques to solve specific problem

5. 20% for the presentation of data-driven insights and the recommendations

6. 10% for the quality of your final team presentation and overall impressions

7. 10% for learning something new and doing something beyond this course

## Problem statement

1. Machine learning main goal: predict rating of the app using features.
