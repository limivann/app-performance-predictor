# App Performance Predictor

Predicting an app performance using Data Science.

## About The Project

This is the mini project for SC1015 (Intro to Data Science and AI) which focuses on android market analysis and app perfomance predictor. For the entire walktrhough of the project, please view the notebooks in this order:

1. [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/limivann/app-rating-predictor/blob/main/data_cleaning.ipynb)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/limivann/app-rating-predictor/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)
3. [Model Building](https://github.com/limivann/app-rating-predictor/blob/main/model_building.ipynb)
4. [Machine Learning](https://github.com/limivann/app-rating-predictor/blob/main/machine_learning.ipynb)

## Problem Defination

Would an app exceed one million installs in a year after it is released?

## Models Used

1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forest Classifier

## Streamlit Web App

For model simulation and visualization purposes, we have created a web app for this project. The link to the website is [here](https://app-performance-predictor.herokuapp.com/).
