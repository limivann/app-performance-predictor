## Marking Rubrics

1. 10% for coming up with your own problem definition based on a dataset

2. 10% for data preparation and cleaning to suit the problem of your choice

3. 20% for exploratory data analysis/visualization to gather relevant insights

4. 20% for the use of machine learning techniques to solve specific problem

5. 20% for the presentation of data-driven insights and the recommendations

6. 10% for the quality of your final team presentation and overall impressions

7. 10% for learning something new and doing something beyond this course

## Problem statement

1. Machine learning main goal: predict rating of the app using features.
2. Which genre of apps has the highest rating?
3. Which country makes the best apps?

Dev
- Best developers and their top categories.
- Developers that made the most apps.

Yifei
- Does editor's choice affect ratings and installs?
- Does size of the app affect total installs? (some people don't like to install large apps)
- Does content rating, price(free / paid), ad supported apps has impact on the rating?
- Does in game purchases affect rating
- Does Day since updated affect rating
- Does day since released affect installs (find apps that has less installs despite released for a long time)
- How to get "High" Rating on Play Store?

Aaron
- App rating distribution
- Top singapore company apps?
- FANG, which company made the best apps?


- Rating VS size/price/installs
- Pricing trend, how to price your app? (Swarmplot)
- Number of reviews VS Number of downloads
